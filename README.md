# Video_Game_Sales_Prediction
This is our Final Project for CS-725: Fundamentals of Machine Learning. 
The video game industry has grown at a tremendous rate over the past few decades, bringing relaxation or excitement to people around the world.. It would be crucial to continuously create innovative and successful games to maintain growth. The project is trying to explore what would be key factors to determine the sales of a game and to predict whether the newly developed game could be successful.

This study can be used by game developers to get a broad understanding of the video- game market to see what types of games are preferred and which variables impact sales. These publishers and developers are in the business of making money and generating sales, so they want to see which variables are most important for sales of their video games. Ideally, the results of our analysis will help developers to decide in which platform, genre, or country to release their future video games.
